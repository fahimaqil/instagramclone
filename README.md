# Sharity
Sharity is an instagram clone app. The purpose of this app is as a platform for the community to share their charity activities to everyone. The link is available here:  https://sharity-app.herokuapp.com

## Tools
* The stack of the app was made by using HTML + CSS (Bootstrap) + JQuery as the frontend and Node.JS (Express.js) as the backend
* The app was deployed using Heroku
* The database was made using local JSON databases

## How it works
*Sharity is a single page application that relies heavily upon AJAX requests to pass JSON objects to and from the server to the client to merge with views that present data.
